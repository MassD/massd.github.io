Like every other functional programming language, it might be a bit obscure to learn, but once you get it, you will find that it helps you think programming in a totally different new way and helps you understand many classic algorithms deeper and finally you will be addictive. At least, this happened to me although I have just learned OCaml for 4 months.\r\n\r\nMongoDB is also awesome. It is fast and easy to setup and scale. The logic inside MongoDB's philosophy on managing data is more human-friendly comparing to SQL. I used MongoDB quite a bit and love it.\r\n\r\nAs a fan of OCaml and MongoDB, I decide to write a MongoDB driver for ocaml, to sharpen my OCaml skills and get deeper understanding on MongoDB. \r\n\r\nHere are my friends, for now\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### [Bson.ml](http://massd.github.io/bson/)\r\n\r\nMongoDB is using [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/#/specification) as its protocol format. The first thing for the OCaml MongoDB Driver is to implement this protocol in OCaml.\r\n\r\nThe current release of Bson.ml is [version 0.88.3](https://github.com/MassD/bson/tree/v0.88.3).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### [Mongo.ml](http://massd.github.io/mongo/)\r\n\r\n**Mongo.ml** is an OCaml Driver for MongoDB. \r\n\r\nThe current version of Mongo.ml is [version 0.66.0](https://github.com/MassD/mongo/tree/v0.66.0)","google":"UA-40567510-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
