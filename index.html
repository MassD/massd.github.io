        <h1>Hello, welcome to MassD projects.</h1>

<p>OCaml is really a beautiful language. Like every other functional programming language, it might be a bit Obscure to learn, but once you get it, you will find that it helps you think programming in a totally different new way and helps you understand many classic algorithms deeper and finally you will be addictive. At least, this happened to me although I have just learned OCaml for 4 months.</p>

<p>MongoDB is also awesome. It is fast and easy to setup and scale. The logic inside MongoDB's philosophy on managing data is more human-friendly comparing to SQL. I used MongoDB quite a bit and love it.</p>

<p>As a fan of OCaml and MongoDB, I decide to write a MongoDB driver for ocaml, to sharpen my OCaml skills and get deeper understanding on MongoDB. </p>

<p>Here are my friends, for now</p>

<hr><h3><a href="http://massd.github.io/ocaml_bson/">Bson.ml</a></h3>

<p>MongoDB is using <a href="http://bsonspec.org/#/specification">BSON</a> as its protocol format. The first thing for the OCaml MongoDB Driver is to implement this protocol in OCaml.</p>

<p>The current release of Bson.ml is <a href="https://github.com/MassD/ocaml_bson">version 0.88.0</a>.</p>

<hr><h3>Mongo.ml</h3>

<p>This project has not been released yet and it will be the 2nd step after Bson.ml. </p>

<p>Many people in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> suggest now writing one by myself as it is too troublesome. However, let me try...</p>
